# R-Basics

## Overview
This project is designed to practice essential R programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and class checking. The code demonstrates various calculations and stores results in variables, allowing for easy manipulation and inspection of data types.

## Key Operations Covered:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition (8 + 5)
- Subtraction (22 - 6)
- Multiplication (6 * 7)
- Division ((4 + 6) / 2)
- Modulo (5 %% 2)

## Variable Assignments:
- Storing values in variables (e.g., x, y, z, class_name, and is_good)
- Printing variable values to check results.
  
## Class Checking:
Using the class() function to check the data type of variables like is_good, z, and class_name.
